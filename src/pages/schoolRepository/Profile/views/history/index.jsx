      <h2>Historial</h2>

      <p>
        Established in 1872, as the first University College in Wales,
        Aberystwyth University is one of the UKâ€™s most important institutions.
        Our reputation for research power, teaching excellence, graduate
        employability and our unbelievable location are what set us apart from
        other universities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aberystwyth is a vibrant and welcoming university town in a stunning
        location on the west coast of the UK. It is both at the heart of Wales
        and home to a rich variety of cultures, people and entertainment. It is
        home to the impressive National Library of Wales: one of few places to
        contain a copy of every book ever printed in the UK.
      </p>

      <p>
        For international students, we offer generous Scholarships covering the
        cost of your accommodation, as well as free gym membership, visa and
        immigration advice, careers support and transport to Aberystwyth upon
        arrival to the UK.
