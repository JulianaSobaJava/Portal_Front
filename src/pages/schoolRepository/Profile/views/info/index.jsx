          Established in 1872, as the first University College in Wales,
          Aberystwyth University is one of the UKâ€™s most important institutions.
          Our reputation for research power, teaching excellence, graduate
          employability and our unbelievable location are what set us apart from
          other universities.

          Aberystwyth is a vibrant and welcoming university town in a stunning
          location on the west coast of the UK. It is both at the heart of Wales
          and home to a rich variety of cultures, people and entertainment. It
          is home to the impressive National Library of Wales: one of few places
          to contain a copy of every book ever printed in the UK.
